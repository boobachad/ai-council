# Pointers

1. **persona** = council members or chairman, **models** ≠ council members or chairman
2. debate is an additional feature from the getgo its supposed to be a simple chat thing
3. each persona will have name, prompt, model
4. models to use:
    - Why Open Router?
    Using Open Router coz it will provide all the freely available models at one place no need to scrible around.
    - we will use open router also in addition to other providers. this is good but for chairmen we need a model which has great context since when reaching the final phase/stage there will be so much content that the free models wont be able to handle it well.
